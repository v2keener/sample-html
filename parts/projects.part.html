  All of these projects are for learning and fun. It is my nature to engineer things, and I do my best to follow best practices.

  <li><b>vidadelafuerza.com:</b> This website is in "vanilla" HTML and CSS. It is designed and organized to be
    accessible, easy to read, and compatible with mobile browsers. Feel free to (<a href="https://github.com/v2keener/sample-html"
      target="_blank">visit the source on Github</a>). Following are some special things about this site:
      <ul>
        <li>Development environment is powered by PowerShell, NodeJS, Neovim, Visual Studio Code, and Windows Terminal</li>
        <li>Testing with <code>lynx</code> is via Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and Oracle Enterprise Linux 9 (OEL9 / RHEL9)</li>
        <li>The source is based on and forked from DigitalOcean's default "simple-html" template site</li>
        <li>SCSS is used to interpret the CSS, and both this "Projects" section and the "About" section (and any further sections I might add) are based on "parts" and a number of background PowerShell jobs</li>
        <li>As of 2024 01 28, this is my favorite project, because I'm not running out of interesting things to learn or try</li>

    <b>Obsidian notetaking:</b> Special thanks to <a href="https://dynalist.io/" target="_blank"
      title="Visit dynalist.io">Dynalist</a> for offering Obsidian! I use it for all of my notes. Those notes are
    CLI-searchable and also able to be manipulated with tools like <code>grep</code>, <code>awk</code>, and
    <code>sed</code>.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Obsidian.md note-taking is pretty great ðŸ’–, especially if you like managing your notes in
        Markdown.

    <b><a href="https://github.com/v2keener/gdlf-overlay" target="_blank">Obsidian Overlay</a> project:</b>
    A project I've published is called "Overlay", and it takes <a href="https://github.com/kepano" target="_blank"
      title="Stephan Ango">@kepano</a>'s default Obsidian theme and
    merely adds a few extra things (rather than being an entire, fresh Obsidian Theme). Check it out
    <a href="https://github.com/v2keener/gdlf-overlay" target="_blank">on Github</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>Sidebar: My CV is exported to PDF with Obsidian using my custom Overlay theme and a
        <code>media-print.css</code>
        Snippet I created to make it print nicely. (CV available upon request. <em>LinkedIn is the best way to
          contact me.)</em>

    <b><em>Delafuerza Print</em> OpenType font project:</b> <span class="gdlf-print">This text is in "Delafuerza
      Print",
      which I created with <a href="https://www.calligraphr.com/en/" target="_blank"
        title="Visit Calligraphr's website">Calligraphr</a>, <a href="https://inkscape.org/" target="_blank"
        title="visit Inkscape's website">Inkscape</a>, and
      a Wacom tablet. Here's how that worked:</span>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Calligraphr</b> was used to
        <ul>
          <li>a) download PDF templates to fill out with Inkscape, and</li>
          <li>b) upload those hand-written PDFs for Calligraphr to parse them into the
            <b>Delafuerza Print</b> font.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Inkscape</b> was used with a Wacom writing tablet to fill in PDF templates for Calligraphr.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
