  About Me

  <b>I live and work from home in Morgantown, West Virginia, USA</b> for a local company, <a
    href="https://wvnet.edu/">WVNET</a>.

<div>
  My work involves advanced technical support of hosted <a href="https://www.ellucian.com/solutions/ellucian-banner"

<div>
  Banner is a complex enterprise resource planning (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning"
    target="_blank">ERP</a>)
  software, so all departments of WVNET are involved in its maintenance and support. There are integrations to
  establish and maintain, some public presentations, and a lot of learning.

  Also: I am an avid <code>bash</code> and <code>PowerShell</code> scripting advocate and software developer. As an
  engineer, I never stop learning.
